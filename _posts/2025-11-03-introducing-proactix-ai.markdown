## Proactix AI: Proactive Compliance for Pharma Reps

**ProActix gives pharma reps real-time compliance updates, AI-driven risk detection, and automates medical affairs handoffs to protect reps and speed responses.**

### Product History and Positioning

Born to fill pharma’s compliance gaps, Proactix integrates predictive alerts and closed-loop inquiry workflows right inside the rep’s daily tools. Proactix transforms pharma sales compliance from reactive Q&A to proactive, real-time risk detection and workflow automation.

### Why Proactix Matters

Pharmaceutical sales reps often face complex compliance risks and regulatory scrutiny in real-time interactions with healthcare professionals. Proactix equips reps with the tools they need to:

- Prevent compliance violations before they occur  
- Enable seamless, automated handoffs to Medical Affairs for off-label or complex inquiries  
- Boost confidence and productivity through AI-driven insights  
- Capture data-driven real-time insights to guide sales and compliance decisions

### Our Vision

We envision a future where pharmaceutical compliance is not a reactive hurdle but an integrated, proactive workflow, empowering teams to focus on patient safety, regulatory adherence, and impactful medical collaboration.
