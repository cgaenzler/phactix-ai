# Phactix AI Initial Demo Video Walkthrough

We are excited to share the first official demo video for the **Phactix AI** application, walking through the core compliance workflow.

This video covers the full user journey: from selecting a meeting and giving **consent** to triggering the **compliance alert** during a live conversation.
